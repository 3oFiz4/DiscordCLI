## Caution
You are free to use this as a **selfbot**, although I need to remind you that it **is quite risky and may get your account banned**, since this violates Discord TOS. And **I AM NOT responsible if your account gets banned**.
Instead, use this on an alternative account, or within your Discord BOT.
