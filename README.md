## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

This client acts like a **selfbot**, and using it **violates Discord's TOS**.  
You **may get banned**.  
I am **not responsible** for any account loss.  

‚úÖ Use an **alt account**, or use within a proper **Discord Bot** context.

## üöÄ Setup
First of all. Set up your token first. There's 2 way.
> a. `python main.py -t [YOUR_TOKEN]` 
> b. 
1. Open / Create your token.txt. Insert this template:
```
---
Username: Account_Username_0
Token: Token_Username_0
---
Username: Account_Username_1
Token: Token_Username_1
---
```
2. And replace Token_Username_0 with each desired token. You can also add more entry if you want to.
3. Then do `python main.py -s [index_token]/[username]`
> Example:
> `python main.py -s 1` # Starts Token_Username_1
> `python main.py -s Account_Username_1` # Starts token of Account_Username_1
4. REMEMBER, it should be Username-Token as the template, do not skip it, not even the <Space> between Token and :.
c. `python main.py` # Is equal to `python main.py -s 0`
### üîπ Fresh Start
```bash
python main.py
# then use -h or -changelog
````

### üîπ Add to System PATH (Recommended)

1. Clone this repo to:
   `C:/Users/[your-name]/DisCLI`
2. Open `System Properties` ‚Üí `Advanced` ‚Üí `Environment Variables`
3. Under **System Variables**, edit `Path`
4. Add:
   `C:\Users\[your-name]\DisCLI\`
5. Click `OK` on all windows.

Now you can run `main.py` from anywhere.
