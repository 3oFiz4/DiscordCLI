# 1.1 Concepts and Referents

When we classify, we make use of {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">concepts—ideas</span>} that represents {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">classes of things we have grouped together</span>}.
<!--ID: 1729425667813-->


In classifying our courses, we used {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">concept</span>} such as ART, HISTORY, and INTRODUCTORY. (Uppercase letters to indicate a concept.). 
<!--ID: 1729425669803-->


To learn the word “dog”, we had to acquire the concept of {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">DOG</span>}
(Uppercase letters to {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">indicate a concept.</span>}). 
<!--ID: 1729425669926-->


If I discover a new phenomenon, I also (did what?) {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">forms a concept for that class of thing</span>} in which I express the {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">concept in a new word (e.g. “quark”)</span>}. 
<!--ID: 1729425670029-->


Concepts and words are intimately related. A concept is an {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">idea</span>}; word is the {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">linguistic vehicle used to express the idea</span>}.
<!--ID: 1729425670083-->


The class of things that a concept stands for are called the {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">referents of the concept</span>}. The referents of DOG, for example, are all the {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">individual dogs in the world.</span>}. Write the diagram the relation between a concept and its referents:
{3:![[Pasted image 20241019140644.png]]}
<!--ID: 1729425670403-->


![[Pasted image 20241019140644.png]]
In here, black dots stand for {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">individual objects</span>}. The bracketing line indicate that certain objects (Lassie, Hound, Chicua) are {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">included within the concept—they are the referents of DOG</span>}, while other things are excluded such as ({1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">my cat, the Taj Mahal, and everything that is not a dog</span>})
<!--ID: 1729425670464-->



Consider the concept ANIMAL. The diagram would look like the one we just did for DOG. But these concepts are obviously related: dogs are a type of animal. That manes we can represent both concepts in the same diagram:
![[Pasted image 20241019141644.png]]
In this diagram also, all referents included in DOG are also {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">included in ANIMAL</span>}, but ANIMAL includes many other things as well—cats. ANIMAL is a broader concept because {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">it includes more than the narrower concept DOG</span>}. Whenever we encounter this relationship, we use the term {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px"><b>genus</b></span>} for {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">broader concept</span>} and {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px"><b>species</b></span>} for {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">narrower one</span>}. Therefore, DOG and CAT are both {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">species</span>} within a {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">genus</span>} ANIMAL.
<!--ID: 1729425670517-->


In logic, genus can be {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">any group to which a species belongs</span>}. In biology, it is a kingdom. “Genus” and “species” are {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">relative terms</span>}, like “mother” and “daughter.”
|
Your {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">mother</span>} is also a daughter—in relation to *her* parents. In the same way, a given concept can be either {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">genus or a species</span>}, depending on our {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">persepective</span>}. DOG is a {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">species</span>} in relation to ANIMAL, but it is a {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">genus</span>} in relation to the narrower concept BEAGLE.

Classify these species of items to the relation of it’s genus:
- {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">Chair, Table, Television</span>} = {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">Furniture</span>}
<!--ID: 1729425670637-->


The referents of our concepts are {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">concrete</span>}, each is {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">single, individual object</span>}. If {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">we had separate names for each referent</span>} (as we do in the case of people), the names would also be {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">concrete</span>}. But a concept (such as {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">PEOPLE or CITY</span>}) is {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">abstract</span>}.
|
	Abstract
	=> {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">a concept refers to a group of objects, not just a single thing (as a name does)</span>}, example: The concept {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">PEOPLE includes all human beings; CITY includes all cities</span>}
	=> {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">it groups together things that differ from one another</span>}
There are many differences among people, among cities, among the referents of any concept. We group them together, not because they are identical but because they are {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">similar</span>}.
<!--ID: 1729425670740-->


Abstractness is a relative property:
> Relative property
> => {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">characteristic or quality that only has meaning when COMPARED to something else</span>}
> Example:
> A tall building in a small town might be short in New York (makes sense when is compared)
> 
> Which is oppositional to Absolute property, such as (6 feet tall)
<!--ID: 1729425670780-->


Abstractness is a relative property. Any concept is {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">abstract</span>} to some {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">degree</span>}. But a species is less abstract than the genus to which it belongs. The analogy of this are: {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">Vehicle (Abstract) includes automobile, motorcycle, plane. As for plane though (Less-Abstract), it got Fighter Jet, Air Bus and etc. </span>}. Therefore, that concludes that the genus is a {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">larget and broader group; it has more referents than the species does</span>}. Draw the diagram of the degree of Abstractness and Concreteness:
{1:![[Drawing 2024-10-19 16.21.06.excalidraw]]}
<!--ID: 1729425670826-->


Crucial to stress that the term “{2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">concrete</span>}” is not limited to {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">physical, tangible</span>} not does the term “{2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">abstract</span>}” mean {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">intangible</span>}. 
<!--ID: 1729425670848-->


The feelings we have at a given moment, for example, are not {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">tangible</span>}, but they are {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">concrete</span>}. The concepts we use to classify feelings are measured in the same way as other concepts. The concept LOVE is more abstract than its species, such as {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">ROMANTIC LOVE</span>}, but less abstract than its genus, {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">EMOTION</span>}.
<!--ID: 1729425670892-->


## Exercise

# 1.2 Rules of Classification

## 1.2A Consistent Principle 

(Consistent Principle)
Suppose that you want to classify the following categories: ART, BIOLOGY, HISTORY, ECONOMICS, and INTROUCTORY. Where would you put “Introduction to Art”? Because in here my categories are {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">overlap, and here we do not know whether to classify this as an introductory coures or an art course</span>, this is called <b>mutually inclusive</b>}. We express this logic by saying the species must be {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">mutually exclusive</span>}: {3:<span style="background-color:#9bff6988;border-radius:5px">Each species must exclude all the members of every other species. 
</span>}. 
<!--ID: 1729425671045-->


(Consistent Principle)
Express mutually exclusive in a Venn diagram:
![[1. Classification 2024-10-20 13.08.51.excalidraw]]


(Consistent Principle)
A good classification divides up the {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">genus completely</span>}, allowing us to {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">assign every member of the genus to one or another of the species</span>}. We express this logic by saying that the classification must be {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px"><b>jointly exhaustive</b></span>}: {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">the species taken together (jointly) must cover (exhaust) all the objects in the genus</span>}.
<!--ID: 1729425671131-->


(Consistent Principle)
The analogy of jointly/collectively exhaustive can be imagined as:
{1:
for each item x, there must be at least one category​ that contains it
<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">Say I thought of Monkey (member), and there are 3 categories, Animal, Plant, Vehicle. So in here Monkey are the species of Animal, and therefore Animal is jointly exhaustive</span>

(Consistent Principle)
If **y** is a specific set of items, say {1, 2}, and none of these items fit into categories A, B, C, or D, then in the context of **y**, the categories are not jointly exhaustive.
}
<!--ID: 1729425671189-->


(Consistent Principle)
Given the the genus of animals that has the species:
(a) those that belong to the emperor
(b) embalmed ones
(c) those that are trained
(d) suckling pigs
(e) mermaids
(f) fabulous ones
(g) stray dogs
(h) those that are included in this classification
(i) those that tremble as if they were mad 
(j) innumerable ones
(k) those drawin with a very fine camel’s hair brush 
(l) others 
(m) those that have just broken a flower vase
(n) those that resemble flies from a distance
|
Prove that these categories are not Mutually Exclusive:
{1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px"> g might resemble n,
a might be k

Therefore, the categories overlap in numerous ways. Strictly speaking, classification is jointly exhaustive because of “(l) others”, but that would be cheating: “Others” is a “miscellaneous” category. Without it, classification would leave out many animals.</span>}
Why would this classification considered inadequate: {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">It is not consistent in dividing up genus. It jumps from the question of ownership (a), condition after death (b), to training (c), and so on. Makes it gives no necessary relationship among these various principles, making classification bound to chaotic. </span>}

(Consistent Principle)
A consistent principle would looks like below furniture diagram consisting of function and style:
{1:![[Pasted image 20241020140646.png]]}
<!--ID: 1729425671256-->


(Consistent Principle)
Consistent principle does not require {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">single principle</span>}. Example, {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">animal species differ from each other in many ways: shape, color, property, anatomy, behavior, and so on. Because of this, Biologists use all these properties in classifying animals.</span>}. Therefore, {3:<span style="background-color:#9bff6988;border-radius:5px">It is appropriate to use multiple principles of classification when dealing with complex phenomena</span>}. Often, single principle are artificial and not useful.
<!--ID: 1729425671335-->


(Consistent Principle)
When using more than one principle, we should take care to make sure that the resulting categories are {1:<span style="background-color:#ff770088;border-radius:5px">mutually exlcusive</span>}. Say, we got Extrovert and Introvert. Extrovert are Outgoing, Frank, Open; Introverts are Reclusive, Cautious, Reserved. Then, where should we categorize Jordan who is Outgoing, Frank, and Cautious? The problem here is the {2:<span style="background-color:#69ffff88;border-radius:5px">various attributes don’t always fit together according to the stereotypes of Extrovert and Introvert, therefore not mutually exclusive</span>}. The solution are, {3:<span style="background-color:#9bff6988;border-radius:5px">pick one of the attributes so that everyone would fit into one or the other category, or create more categories to handle variety of personality types</span>}.
